Each Arduino sketch has a Transmitter.h file that needs to be updated depending on the setup.
The files should be the same in both sketches.

For each Receiver the RECEIVER_NUMBER needs to be incremented

If there are more than 4 Receivers the recieverAddress needs to have more addresses added to it and RECEIVER_COUNT needs to be updated.
